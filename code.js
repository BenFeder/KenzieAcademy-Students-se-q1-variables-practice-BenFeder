// Welcome! Here's an example of a console logged response

// Example: Log an expression that evaluates to the sum of two integers.
console.log(4 + 5);

// Right click anywhere in the file (without any text selected), and select "Run Code"
// At the bottom in the "Output" tab, you should see the answer, 9,
// along with all of the other logged answers.

// Complete the exercises below, logging an answer.

/***********************/
/* Using Expressions   */
/***********************/

// 1.) Log an expression that evaluates multiplying two integers.
// your code here
let answer1 = 4 * 3;
console.log(answer1);

// 2.) log an expression that evaluates to the difference of two integers (subtracting one from the other)
// your code here
let answer2 = 12 - 9;
console.log(answer2);

// 3.) Log an expression that concatenates the two strings "I'm writing" and "my first JavaScript code"
// your code here
let answer3 = "I'm writing" + " " + "my first JavaScript code";
console.log(answer3);

// 4.) Log an expression that evaluates to true or false using two numbers that are greater or less than eachother
// your code here
let x = 42;
let y = 21;
console.log(x > y);

// 5.) Log an expression that uses modulo, with a result of 4
// your code here
let answer5 = 25 % 7;
console.log(answer5);

// 6.) Create a variable and name it "sentence".  Assign a string containing a sentence of text to it.
// Then log the variable.
// Your code here
let sentence = "My favorite color is orange.";
console.log(sentence);

// 7.) Concatenate 4 different strings to form the sentence "I'm learning a bit of JavaScript at Kenzie"
let str1 = "I'm learning ";
let str2 = "a bit ";
let str3 = "of JavaScript ";
let str4 = "at Kenzie";

let answer7 = str1 + str2 + str3 + str4;
console.log(answer7);

// 8.) Add parenthesis to the following statement, the result should be 1
// Hint: You will need three sets of parenthesis

console.log((3 * 3 + 1) / (20 / 2) == 1); // This should log true
